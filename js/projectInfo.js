            LargeDescription: 'Snake eats fruit in an enclosed shape and avoid obstacles. Fruits spawns at random position within the playground. There are two main parts of game, Custom levels and Procedural level. In Custom level, snake has to avoid obstacle in prebaked playground and where as in Procedural level, enclosed shape is a regular polygon with obstacles spawning at random position within playground.<br><br>This game is developed using Unity3D game engine. Game was initially developed to be played over android platform, but game’s simple swipe control allows the gameplay to function with arrow key of joystick controller or keyboard.<br><br>If player chooses Custom level, playground corresponding to level 1 is instantiated along with Snake head and two tails. After this a Fruit is instantiated at random position inside the playground and snake is assigned with random velocity in 4 planar directions (up, down, left, right). Each time Snake eats a fruit, another fruit is instantiated at random position inside playground and a tail is increased in Snake. Snake has to eat a predefined value of minimum number of fruits to eat to surpass any level. If snake eats equal to requirement, player has now option to jump to next level or continue playing this level. If player chooses to go next level, next playground is instantiated and cycle repeats till all Custom levels are completed, after which player wins the game.<br><br>If player chooses Procedural level, an equilateral triangle (minimum sided polygon) is generated along with Snake head and two tails. After this a Fruit is instantiated at random position inside polygon. Snake is assigned with random velocity in 4 planar directions (up, down, left, right). Each time Snake eats a Fruit, another Fruit and an Obstacle are instantiated at two different random position inside the polygon and a tail is increased in Snake. Snake has to eat a predefined value of minimum number of fruits to eat to surpass any level. If snake eats equal to requirement, player has now option to jump to next level or continue playing this level. If player chooses to go next level, polygon with +1 side is generated cycle repeats endlessly.<br><br><div class="text-center"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Nrjnicks/snake3d" type="button" class="btn btn-primary">More Information</a></div>',

            SmallDescription: "ISMAR 2017 (IEEE Publication)",
            LargeDescription: 'The feeling of presence in virtual reality has enabled a large number of applications. These applications typically deal with 360° content. However, a large amount of existing content is available in terms of images and videos i.e 2D content. Unfortunately, these do not react to the viewer position or motion when viewed through a VR Head Mount Device.<br><br>Thus in this work, we propose reactive displays for VR which instigate a feeling of discovery while exploring 2D content. We create this by taking into account user position and motion to compute homography based mappings that adapt the 2D content and re-project it onto the display. This allows the viewer to obtain a more richer experience of interacting with 2D content similar to the effect of viewing through the window at a scene. We also provide a VR interface that uses a constrained set of reactive displays to easily browse through 360° content.<br><br>The proposed interface tackles the problem of nausea caused by existing interfaces like photospheres by providing a natural room-like intermediate interface before changing 360° content. We perform user studies to evaluate both of our interfaces. The results show that the proposed reactive display interfaces are indeed beneficial.',

Gameplay: Maintaining balance between renewable and nonrenewable resources and not let in-game temperature rise by 2 degree Celsius <br><br>• Match-3: Built a match-three mini-game during internship period at Mech Mocha Game Std. Pvt. Lim., where player swaps two gems to make a pattern. Game had various combo moves like: 4-match: vertical or horizonal gem crusher, L shape-match: Bomb, 5-match: similar gem distroyer. <br><br>• Tower and Creeps: A tower defense game where player defends Home Tower by placing small towers to hit the Creeps and prevent them to reach the base. <br><br>• Escher Effect: Mimicked an illusion in virtual space. This illusion was also used in game- Monument Valley (by- Us Two).<br><br>• BodyShape: Educational grid game, where player completes a body by using tiles which can only be obtained if the number of turns already took is equal to the space between two tiles.",
